# app/__init__.py

# This file marks the 'app' directory as a Python package.
# It allows Python and tools like pytest to recognize
# this directory as a package so modules inside can be imported.

# It can be left empty if no package-level initialization is needed.

# This file runs automatically the first time the package is imported.
# You could use it to execute initialization code for the whole package,
# import submodules to simplify imports, or define package-level variables.

# For this project, this file is intentionally left empty.
